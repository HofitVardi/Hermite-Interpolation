A complementary code for "Geometric Hermite Interpolation in $\mathbb{R}^n$"

The atteched files contains implementions of the B'ezier average computation and of the modified LR-algorithms as well as several examples.

Run "Example" for viewing a 3D demonstrstion of the process of generainting curves by the IHB-scheme (See section 3 in the paper).
